      <img src="circuit 2.jpeg" alt="Photo of a breadboard with three LEDs connected to an arduino board."/>
      <p>This photo shows the circuit. There are three LEDs, four resistors, a button, a breadboard, and an arduino board.</p>

      <img src="Adobe Express - fade vid.gif" alt="A gif showing three LEDs fading high to low at the same time."/>
      <p>This is the video of the LEDs fading high to low at the same time.</p>

      <img src="schematic and calculations 2.jpg" alt="Calculations for resistors and a schematic of three LEDS in paralell with resistors plus a button."/>
      <p>This photo shows how I calculated the resistor values for the circuit and the schematic I drew to represent the circuit</p>

      <h2> Additional Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>
            In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations.
          </h3>
          <img src="graph 2.jpg" alt="A drawing of an LED with 3 different analogWrite values."/>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>
            Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage. Plot the voltage at V-measure (where your pin is reading the voltage) of your voltage divider of your shared gif/video.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The total current draw would be 60mA if all three LEDs were on simultaneously (20mA each). This is below the Arduino's recommended maximum current draw of 200mA. If powered by a 1200 mAh battery, the circuit would run for about 20 hours (1200 mAh / 60 mA = 20 hours).

        <li>
          <h3>
            AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values. Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code? Explain your answer.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The actual voltage for my red LED when it's on is 1.82V. This is within the theoretical forward voltage for red LEDs, which ranges from 1.8V to 2.2V.

            Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? If yes, please provide details on how/when, as well as a brief reflection. If no, you can either leave this question blank, or provide other information if you'd like.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I used ChatGPT to check my code - which did not prove helpful. This is because I had the GND connected to the wrong pin the whole time, which is why my code wasn't working.
