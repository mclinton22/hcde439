      <img src="circuit photo.jpeg" alt="Photo of a breadboard with three red LEDs connected to an arduino board."/>
      <p>This photo shows the circuit. There are three LEDs, three resistors, a breadboard, and an arduino board.</p>

      <img src="circuit vid.gif" alt="A gif showing three LEDs blinking one at a time in a loop."/>
      <p>This is the (unfortunatly low quality) video of the LEDs blinking one at a time.</p>

      <img src="resistor and schematic.jpg" alt="Calculations for resistors and a schematic of three LEDS in paralell with resistors."/>
      <p>This photo shows how I calculated the resistor values for the circuit and the schematic I drew to represent the circuit</p>

      <h2> Arduino Code</h2>
      <pre>
        int pin1 = 13; // blue wire
        int pin2 = 12; // white wire
        int pin3 = 11;// orange wire

        // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
        void setup() {
          // initializes the 3 pins as an output.
          pinMode(pin1, OUTPUT);
          pinMode(pin2, OUTPUT);
          pinMode(pin3, OUTPUT);
        }

        // the loop function runs over and over again forever
        void loop() {
          // turns pin1 on, keeps the other 2 off
          digitalWrite(pin1, HIGH);
          digitalWrite(pin2, LOW); // turns pin2 off
          digitalWrite(pin3, LOW); // turns pin3 off
          // adds a 1 second delay
          delay(1000);
          // turns pin2 on, keeps the other 2 off
          digitalWrite(pin2, HIGH);
          digitalWrite(pin1, LOW); // turns pin1 off
          digitalWrite(pin3, LOW); // turns pin3 off
          // adds a 1 second delay
          delay(1000);
          // turns pin3 on, keeps other 2 off
          digitalWrite(pin3, HIGH);
          digitalWrite(pin1, LOW); // turns pin1 off
          digitalWrite(pin2, LOW); // turns pin2 off
          delay(1000);
        }

      <h2> Additional Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>
            Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led, 255).
          </h3>
          <img src="graph.jpg" alt="A drawing of the voltage of each LED, one second at a time."/>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>
            If all your LEDs were on simultaneously, what would the total current draw be? Is this above or below the total Arduino current draw limits? If all your LEDs were on, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?
          </h3>
          <p>
            With my Arduino board, I can blink up to 14 LEDS independently, 0-13. The current would draw 20mA (assuming all are red LEDs), making a total of 280mA. Assuming each LED lit up separately, the current would be 20mA.
          </p>

        <li>
          <h3>
            Measure and record the actual voltage across one of your LEDs when it's on. How does this compare to the theoretical forward voltage for your LED color?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Changing the delay down to 10 milliseconds makes the LEDs blink so fast that it looks like they are not blinking at all.

          <p>I looked up how to make a code snippet in HTML but I did not use any AI in this project.</p>
